# JS-Sorting

This repo includes the problems and tests for the first half week two of the computer science unit, but this time in JS.

## Steps to Run:

1. Run `npm i` to install dependancies
2. Run `npm run test` to watch jest test suites

### Additional Run Options

- Run `npm run test <test directory>` to watch a specific test suite ie: `npm run test iterativeSorting` to watch only the tests inside the iterativeSorting directory
- You can run `npm run test` with the `--verbose` option to see more test output
- Run `npx run <path_to_JS_file>` to run individual JavaScript files, ie: `npx run iterativeSorting/index.js` to run the index file in the iterativeSorting directory
