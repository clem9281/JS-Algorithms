# JS-Sorting

This repo includes the problems and tests for the first half week two of the computer science unit, but this time in JS.

## Steps to Run:

1. Run `npm i` to install dependancies
2. Run `npm run test` to run all jest test suites or
3. Run `npm run test <test directory>` to run a specific test suite i.e: `npm run test iterativeSorting` to watch only the tests inside the iterativeSorting directory

- Also you can run `npm run test` with the `--verbose` option to see more test output
